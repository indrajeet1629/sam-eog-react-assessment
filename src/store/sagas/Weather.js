  1. The weather service requires us to make a search by lat/lng to find its
  weather ID.
  2. We then use that weather ID to get the weather.

  This process is pretty well defined here with a saga.

  call invokes a method
  put dispatches an action
  takeEvery watches actions and executes a function

  Also -- the `*` in function is important; turns it into a "generator"
